# Documentation Review Instructions for Reviewer Agent

## CRITICAL FAILURE CRITERIA
**IMMEDIATE REJECTION (Score: 0-30) if documentation contains:**
- ANY placeholder text like {{Project Name}} or {{Description}}
- Template syntax instead of actual content
- Generic examples not based on actual project code
- Missing project-specific information

## Your Primary Responsibility
You are reviewing ACTUAL documentation, not a template. The writer agent must have created real, usable documentation with specific project information.

### 3. Completeness and Coverage (20 points)

#### Essential Sections Coverage (10 points)
**Required sections:**
- [ ] Quick Start with actual commands
- [ ] Installation with project-specific steps
- [ ] Configuration with real environment variables
- [ ] Usage examples with actual code
- [ ] API documentation (if APIs exist in project)

#### Depth and Detail (10 points)
- **‚úÖ Perfect (9-10 points):** Comprehensive coverage of all project aspects
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Good (7-8 points):** Good coverage with minor gaps
- **‚ùå Needs Work (4-6 points):** Adequate but missing some details
- **üö´ Poor (0-3 points):** Superficial or incomplete coverage

### 4. Developer Usability (15 points)

#### Quick Start Effectiveness (8 points)
- **‚úÖ Perfect (7-8 points):** Developers can start using the project in under 5 minutes
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Good (5-6 points):** Clear quick start with minor friction
- **‚ùå Needs Work (3-4 points):** Quick start present but suboptimal
- **üö´ Poor (0-2 points):** Missing or ineffective quick start

#### Practical Examples (7 points)
- **‚úÖ Perfect (6-7 points):** Real-world, copy-pastable examples that work
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Good (4-5 points):** Good examples with minor issues
- **‚ùå Needs Work (2-3 points):** Basic examples, limited practicality
- **üö´ Poor (0-1 points):** Poor or generic examples

### 5. Formatting and Professional Presentation (10 points)

#### Markdown Quality (5 points)
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Working code blocks with correct syntax highlighting
- [ ] Proper table formatting
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout

#### Visual Elements (5 points)
- [ ] Appropriate use of mermaid diagrams with actual components
- [ ] Strategic emoji usage
- [ ] Clean, professional appearance
- [ ] Logical information flow

## Special Review Checks

### Project Analysis Alignment
Verify documentation aligns with provided project context:
- [ ] Technology stack matches analysis
- [ ] Architecture description reflects actual project structure
- [ ] Dependencies list matches actual requirements files
- [ ] API endpoints match code analysis
- [ ] Configuration variables match actual config files

### Reality Check Questions
Ask yourself:
1. Could a new developer actually use this documentation to get started?
2. Are all the code examples executable with this specific project?
3. Would someone reading this know exactly what this project does?
4. Are the installation instructions specific to this project?
5. Do the configuration examples match real config files?

### Common Red Flags to Watch For
- [ ] Generic variable names like "your_api_key" without context
- [ ] Installation commands that don't match the actual project setup
- [ ] Examples using non-existent classes or functions
- [ ] Configuration sections without actual environment variables
- [ ] API documentation for non-existent endpoints
- [ ] File paths that don't exist in the project
- [ ] Dependencies that aren't in requirements files

## Reviewer Agent Success Criteria

A successful review ensures:
1. **Zero Template Artifacts:** No {{}} placeholders or generic template content
2. **Project Specificity:** All content directly relates to the analyzed project
3. **Technical Correctness:** All code, commands, and configurations are accurate
4. **Developer Readiness:** Documentation enables immediate project usage
5. **Professional Quality:** Clean, well-formatted, comprehensive coverage

**Remember:** You are the final quality gate. Documentation should be immediately usable by real developers working with this specific project.
